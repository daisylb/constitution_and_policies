Sub-committee policy V3
=======================


Overview
--------

Subcommittees are a service Linux Australia offers to open source 
community.  They are open source groups that have chosen to become
part of Linux Australia and thus take advantage of being legal entity
that can provide logistical resources like insurance, bank accounts,
accounting facilities, taxation, name recognition and financial
backing.


Definitions
-----------

* An subcommittee is classified as either an Event Subcommittee
  which is created to run an event over a fixed period and then
  disbands or a Standing Subcommittee, which runs until it is
  wound up.

* A subcommittee can be trading which means it manages money,
  requires a bank account and accounting facilities or
  non-trading.

* Trading subcommittee's that borrow money from Linux
  Australia are called pecuniary subcommittees.


Committee Home Page
-------------------

All Subcommittees must maintain their home page on Linux Australia's
web site.  (Out of date home pages is one of the ways Linux Australia
detects inactive Subcommittee's.)  The home page must contain the
following information on it somewhere that is available to the
public:

* The name of the subcommittee.

* The subcommittees objectives.  This tells interested people what
  the subcommittee does.

* How to contact the subcommittee and the expected response time.
  The subcommittee must have provide a means of doing this, but
  may ask Linux Australia to providing a mailing list that will be
  managed by them.

* The name of the current director of the subcommittee.  Trading
  subcommittees must also nominate their treasurer.

* A list of current and past activities.  At a minimum this section
  must contain all the annual reports it gives to Linux Australia.

* A list of additional web sites, email lists, social media and
  similar acidities the subcommittee maintains.

* Standing subcommittees must also have the follow on their web site.
  Event subcommittees are not required to have these items.

  * The name of people on the board and their roles.

  * If a standing subcommittee will not unconditionally accept all
    Linux Australia members as ordinary members it must state what
    the criteria for membership is.  For example a subcommittee that
    manages conference bids might say its members generally been
    involved in running the conference in prior years.  Or the
    subcommittee might place an upper limit on the number of
    members it can accept.
    
  * If a standing subcommittee limits membership it must describe the
    process it uses to admit members.  This process must be
    transparent: for example, an open vote by the board, recorded in
    the minutes.

  * The date & place of the meeting that will elect board members
    must be announced and listed on this page with least 2 weeks
    notice.

* Event subcommittees must maintain a list of details for their event.

  * Event opening and closing dates.
  * The main venue.
  * Planned opening of ticket sales and relevant URL.
  * Open and closing of call for papers.

* Any other rules and by-laws the subcommittee may wish to provide.

The following details must also be available from the home page,
but do not have to be public.

* A list of personal contact details.  At a minimum this list must
  contain all board members.  The details must include a current
  phone number and email address. IM details are often helpful (eg,
  idles on irc freenode#channel).  Noting the secure mechanism such
  available (such as GPG keys or Signal) is also helpful.

* The details of all accounts the subcommittee maintains:

  * Which of the above contacts have access to each bank account,
    and what payment authorisation level they have.

  * Which of the above contacts have access to Xero, and their
    authorisation level.

  * Which of the above contacts need access to the Linux Australia
    web site, and the access level.

  * Which of the above contacts need access to payment gateways
    (eg Stripe), and the access level.

* Standing subcommittees must maintain a list of current members
  that is accessible to the Linux Australia Executive and available
  on request to other members.

* Pecuniary subcommittees must provide a read only link to their live
  budget.


Establishing a subcommittee
---------------------------

To establish a subcommittee go through the following steps:

* Only Linux Australia members can establish subcommittees, so the
  first step is to ensure you are all current members.

* Send an email to council@linux.org.au stating you are establishing
  a subcommittee giving a brief description of what the subcommittee
  will do, and nominating a potential URL for the subcommittee's
  home page.  If the executive does not respond within 28 days feel
  free to hound them.

* If the Linux Australia executive gives you access create the
  subcommittee home page as described above, but do not make it
  public.  The home page is the formal proposal to create the
  subcommittee and it is primarily what Linux Australia will have
  it's decision on.  The council will probably ask for
  clarifications and changes.

* If the council decides to accept a trading subcommittee the
  board members must now complete a training course (induction)
  before they will be given access to Linux Australia
  infrastructure.

* The new subcommittee board must communicate in writing all the
  subcommittee members will follow this and all other applicable
  Linux Australia policies, procedures and its constitution.  Non
  pecuniary subcommittees must also acknowledge they will be
  personally liable for any expenses that exceed the balance of their
  bank account.  Pecuniary subcommittees must acknowledge if the
  event makes a loss and the events expenditure exceeded the total
  of normal expenditure listed in the budget plus any expenditure
  subsequently agreed to in writing by Linux Australia, they will
  be personally liable whichever is smaller - the loss or the excess
  expenditure.

* Only on completion of all of the above is the subcommittee is the
  formally established.  The home page of a standing subcommittees
  will be published immediately, and it's establishment and URL will
  be announced to the Linux Australia membership.  Event
  subcommittees can at their option delay the announcement.

Pecuniary subcommittees must include a budget spreadsheet in their
proposal:

* Currently all events requiring funding from Linux Australia must 
  return a minimum 6% gross profit to Linux Australia.  Gross profit
  is calculated as (profit returned before tax * 100 divided by
  income from all sources).

* The budget should include discretionary expenditure items.  These
  discretionary expenses must be incurred only when it is reasonably
  certain the event attain the minimum gross profit.

* All normal and discretionary expenditure items must be arise from
  running the event, and must be expected to be incurred before the
  subcommittee is wound up.

* The budget must show the minimum gross profit  at the expected
  attendance level with all discretionary items included.

* If the event was held in previous years, the budget must show
  the minimum gross profit with all discretionary items included
  at the previous years attendance.

* The budget must show a profit at the 75% smaller of last years
  attendance and the expected attendance with no discretionary items
  included.

* The budget may include wish list items.  Wish list expenditure
  items can be only be incurred if the event is expected to exceed
  the minimum gross profit.  Unlike normal and discretionary
  expenditure items wish list items do not need to be directly
  related to running the event, however unrelated expenses will be
  paid by the Linux Australia treasurer once the subcommittee has
  wound up.

* The budget must be accompanied by preliminary quotes for the major
  expenditure items such as the venue and catering.

  in the next 4 weeks.

* No subcommittee may incur liabilities that exceed the balance of

  it's feasible to do so.

* If a non-pecuniary subcommittee may choose to disassociate
  themselves from Linux Australia and in doing so are welcome to
  transfer their assets another entity, provided that entities
  objectives align with Linux Australia's statement of objects and
  the subcommittees objectives.
