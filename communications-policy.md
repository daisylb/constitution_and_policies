Communications Policy
=====================

Definitions
-----------

### *Channel Member*
A natural person, who may or may not be a member of Linux Australia, who has voluntarily or as part of their membership of Linux Australia, been subscribed to one or more communication channels hosted by Linux Australia.  To continue being a *Channel Member*, the *Channel Member* accepts to be bound by this policy.

### *Communication Channel* (or *Channel*)
Electronic infrastructure whose purpose is to send *Post*s to all people who are subscribed to the *channel*.  This may be a mailing list, chat system, social media account, or other electronic communication tools. This also includes private communications, being one-to-one or other private forum, made in the context of and including portions of copy from the original *channel*.

### *Council*
The member-elected governing body of Linux Australia.  *Council* has the authority to create, moderate and delete *Communication Channel*s and *Post*s therein for all *Communication Channel*s it hosts, and the authority to delegate these actions to *Moderator*s.  *Council* is responsible for creating, promulgating and enforcing this policy.

### *Code of Conduct*
The Linux Australia *[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linuxaustralia/constitution_and_policies/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)* applies to all members of Linux Australia and all activity that occurs within environments that Linux Australia looks after, either directly or indirectly, unless overridden by a specific *Code of Conduct* for that environment (eg. a conference may have a separate *Code of Conduct* that applies to *Communications Channel*s that apply to it).

### *Moderator*
A natural person with delegated authority to create, moderate, and delete *Communication Channel*s and *Post*s therein in line with this policy.  A *Moderator* is appointed at the discretion of *Council* and may be changed at *Council*'s discretion.  *Council* authorises *Moderator*s to act without seeking prior approval from *Council* and trusts them to exercise their duties responsibly and professionally.

### *Post*
Either:

a. Any single piece of content sent to a *Communication Channel* by a *Channel Member*.  Depending on the *Communication Channel*, this may be referred to by other terms such as but not limited to "comment" or "reply".

b. The act of sending a *Post* to a *Communication Channel*.


Introduction and Rationale
--------------------------

This document outlines the policy about the acceptable use of communication channels hosted by Linux Australia.  It supersedes the Mailing List Policy.  This policy exists so that:

* *Channel member*s have a clear understanding of what is acceptable
* *Moderator*s of the *channel* alike have a clear understanding of what is acceptable and a basis to take corrective action if required
* *Communication Channel*s are an inclusive instrument for furthering the values of Linux Australia - open technology, community, freedom, respect and diversity.

This policy therefore articulates boundaries around acceptable use of *Communication Channels* by Linux Australia, and defines appropriate actions and recourse for when those boundaries are transgressed.

Policy
------

1. Creation of a *Communication Channel*

  a. Any Member of Linux Australia may request in writing to *Council* that a *Communication Channel* be created.  The request will contain the purpose of the *Communication Channel* and the names of 2 (two) proposed *Moderator*s, who will be Members of Linux Australia. *Council* will consider the creation request, and if approved ensure the *communication channel* is created with the nominated *Moderator*s ascribed appropriate privileges in line with this policy.

  b. The decision to reject a *Communication Channel* creation request is final. In the case of rejection, the *Council* must provide a justification for this in writing to the requestor. The requestor may submit a new request at a later point in time if the situation or context for the rejection changes.

  c. By default and when supported by the platform, *Communication Channel*s will be created such that;
    1. They are publicly viewable and archived
    2. That subscription requests must be confirmed
    3. That only *Channel Member*s may *Post* to the channel

    *Moderator*s will be able to deviate from these defaults at their discretion to best serve the needs of *Channel Member*s.

  d. By default and when supported by the platform, *Communication Channel*s will be in moderation.  This is to protect *Channel Member*s, *Channel Moderator*s and Linux Australia from legal action over defamatory *post*s.  If desired, *Moderator*s may discuss the removal of moderation with *Council*.  *Council* may agree that moderation can be turned off if it can be demonstrated that the risks are acceptably low within the context of the *Communication Channel*.

2. Appointment of *Moderator*s

  a. At creation, each *Communication Channel* will have two *Moderator*s appointed.  *Moderator*s will ensure that there are 2 (two) *Moderator*s active for each *Communication Channel* at all times and will inform *Council* in writing if new *Moderator*s should be appointed for a *Communication Channel*.

  b. *Council* will consider such a request and act to ensure ongoing moderation for a *Communication Channel*, or alternatively determine that the *Communication Channel* should be decommissioned.

3. Acceptable use of *Communication Channel*

  a. A Linux Australia *Communication Channel* may be created to support discussion, free and open exchange of ideas and to build social and intellectual capital amongst *Channel Member*s in the fields of open technology, culture, hardware and software.

  b. A *Channel Member* may subscribe voluntarily or choose to be subscribed as part of their membership of Linux Australia if they are a member.

  c. A *Channel Member* shall be able to unsubscribe at any time.

  d. A *Channel Member* shall ensure that *Post*s they send to a
     *Communications Channel* are in line with our *Code of Conduct*.

4. Moderation of Acceptable Use of *Communication Channel*

  a. Should a violation of clause 3(d) occur, the *Moderator*s of a *Communication Channel* should confer and reach a consensus that a violation has occurred and that response action is warranted.

  b. The *Moderator*s may choose from an escalating list of response actions to ensure the appropriate use of the *Communication Channel*, including;

    1. Private communication to the transgressor outlining how they have transgressed the policy and requesting them to refrain

    2. Temporarily banning the transgressor from the *Communication Channel* for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days

    3. Placing the *Communication Channel* into emergency moderation or 'slowdown' mode

    4. Permanently banning the transgressor from the *Communication Channel*

    5. Recommending to *Council* that the transgressorâ€™s membership of Linux Australia (if a member) be revoked in line with the Constitution

    6. Other actions as deemed appropriate to the context and circumstance and agreed to by *Moderator*s and *Council*

5. Right to Appeal

  a. A transgressor who is the target of a response action from a moderator under 4(b) may appeal to *Council*.

  b. *Council* will deliberate and provide a ruling within 14 (fourteen) days of receiving an appeal.

  c. *Council* may choose from the following outcomes;

    1. *Council* may uphold the actions of the *Moderator*s

    2. *Council* may find that the actions of the *Moderator*s were not in line with this policy and choose to counsel the *Moderator*s or revoke their Moderation privileges and reinstate any privileges of the Channel Member

    3. *Council* may find that the actions of the *Moderator*s were lenient and apply harsher actions to the transgressor
